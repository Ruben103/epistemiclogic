## Theoretical Justification

We believe this game is a nice representation of game theory and bridges well between Public Announcement Logic (PAL) and Common Knowledge (C). Each round consists of several biddings that are higher than the previous one.  This means that all of the agents publicly receive information about what the otherplayer’s beliefs are about the distribution of dice.  PAL does not permit an agentto lie about his beliefs about the dice. Therefore, we will build a module that isable to deceive if that agent thinks its his best move.  The biddings will alwaysbe  a  rational  construct  of  the  common  knowledge  pool  and  each  agents  owndice, adjusted for with probabilities. Despite missing this aspect of the game,we still believe it’s interesting to formalise the choices that our agents will makein particular game settings.
