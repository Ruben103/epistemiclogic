Liar's Dice is a game which, is very difficult to model. That difficulty follows from the fact, that it is still a big challenge to model humans behaviour, even in games. 
The biggest advantage of developing simplified environments like we did in this project, is the ability to simulate a big number of games in relatively short time. 
Analyzing large amount of data gathered from contests played between agents can bring instructive conclusions and give a broader view on the examined problem. 

On the other hand, data gathered from games played between humans might be more corresponded with the Liar's Dice reality. Nevertheless, collecting data from human's games 
would last unimaginably longer.

Regarding our project, the research might be continued by evaluating strategies concluded from experiments in multi-agent system in a number of games played between humans. 
That would give us a valuable information about quality and authenticity of results we obtained from the developed environment.
